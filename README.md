U use the pdf converter by placing the .txt or .md file in the root of the converer folder

then go to cmd or powershell and cd to the folder
then type the code:
python main.py example.txt --output example.pdf

the example.txt in the line of code needs to be changed to the name of the folder you want to be a pdf
example.txt can be .txt if it is a .txt file if it is a .md file you need to use filename.md
